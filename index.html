Whatever we repeat most often, we become. <strong>We teach allied health practitioners for soft tissue recovery and training recovery to personal trainers and strength coaches alike. We have seen many people train themselves into the ground.</strong></p>

          <h3>Are you someone that Trains yourself into the ground?</h3>
          <p>Our bodies cannot distinguish stress triggers thus if we repeatedly hold trauma, anxiety, desperation, fear, frustration and pain, then, we will learn pain patterns, adapt and strengthen that very same pattern that hurt us. Only by moving differently, can we heal</p>
